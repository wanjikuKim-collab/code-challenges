Logic to count negative/ positive elements in an array is as follows:
1. Store the size of the array in a variable
2. Declare and initialize a variable, `count` with zero, to store count of -ve or +ve elements
3. Iterate through each element in the array(run a loop from 0 to the arrays_size)
4. Use if statement inside loop to check if current number is +ve or -ve , then increment count by 1
5. Finally after the loop you are left with total -ve or +ve element count
